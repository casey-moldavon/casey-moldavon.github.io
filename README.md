# updated-portfolio-2

This is my 4th Portfolio iteration, updated with my most recent projects and some additonal related features. Despite looking very similar to my previous portfolio and my most recent project (Medieval avatars), i actually formed this portfolio from scratch and without copying over any code (with exception to needed code for Materialize features).
​
## Getting Started
​
Being my 4th created portfolio, i had a pretty strong idea of what i'd need to do for this project and what features i wanted to use. I started with making the needed folders and files to get started, which actually included nearly all of those currently present with exception to the documents within the fonts folder. These were added later.

By now i had a better idea of how to organize my files and folders which made the entire process a lot easier and quicker to get through.

Starting with my leading feature (the Carousel) to display my projects, i added the necesary code along with some styling to edit the size of the images (something i only recently discovered whule working on another project). In my last portfolio, i featured this same carousel but, using Materialize, i had a lot of trouble altering inner style effects. This issue was solved simply by inspecting the page, viewing the DOM and using their classifications to alter the carousel as needed. Didn't even know such an option was available! I'll post some images below to show the difference between my current portfolio and the last.

These images above are the same scale and size by the way. Thats the carousel size difference.
This and the button hover feature (changing color to match that of the app its attached to) are the only features i kept from the past portfolio.

Searching through the carousel, you'll definitely notice, with my most recent project (Medieval Avatars), that there are a lot of shared appearances and features such as the navbar, sidenav and carousel. These are all concepts I greatly enjoyed working on with that project and thought id add them here. That and they look really good. My only encountered issue here was content. The Medieval Avatars app had dramatically more content and information than my portfolio so it made sense to have these numerous features.

As boring as this is to admit, i actually encountered almost zero complication from this project. I thought to add some interesting new content to challenge myself, even went so far as to work on these features within another doc just incase i found a use for them but, sadly, couldn't find enough content for my portfolio to justify using them. I'll definitely apply them next time though.

I will say that it was refreshing to witness the difference just between this portfolio and my last, not just in terms of features but in terms of simplicity and ease.


One thing i did do quite differently with this app was focusing on a Mobile friendly display as i have recently started applying to jobs and quickly found out, from an outside source, that people looking to hire will occasionally view portfolios and resumes on their phone. Definitely going to start applying this mentality to all future projects. If not just for job hunting then also for overall sharing and practice.
